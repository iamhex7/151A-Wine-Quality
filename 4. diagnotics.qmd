Model Diagnostics Summary (Bullet Points)
Residuals vs Fitted

No strong curvature → linearity assumption satisfied.

Mild heteroscedasticity visible → expected due to discrete 1–10 quality ratings; not severe enough to affect inference.

Normal Q–Q Plot

Central residuals align well with theoretical normal quantiles.

Slight tail deviations → acceptable given large sample size (n > 6000) and CLT-based inference.

No evidence of severe non-normality.

Cook’s Distance

All Cook’s D values are very small (< 0.03), far below conventional influence thresholds.

No influential observations detected.

Residuals vs Leverage

No points fall beyond Cook’s distance contours.

Leverage values low overall → model not driven by outliers or high-leverage cases.
